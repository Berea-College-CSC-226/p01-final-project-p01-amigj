roll system(range random)
(fighting mech. similar to dnd)

@ = its own .py file

@start menu

@game itself (running scenes, start menu, end screen)

@scene# (classes/functions)

    @dialogue boxes (any button press or click makes boxes go)[function or class] Then I can customize the dialogue boxes by printing

    button options [function or class] similar to dialogue but selection has if, elif, and else statements
    (these two may share a .py file or be in the game's file)

win and lose condition leads to end screen

@end screen


img assets need to be pngs (in a folder called images)
character assets (individual name imgs folder)
backgrounds (bkg img folder)
extras such a items or props (extras folder)

   The plan is this:
   1) start screen [semi-hard]
   2) game code [hard]
        2a) dialogue class working
        2b) character placeholder (box)
        2c) getting the story written/so dialouge can be implemented
        2d) button options
   3) end screen [semi-hard]
        3a) get the main end screen working
        3b) optional:win screen
        3c) optional:lose screen
   4) character assets impleted to make the program look pretty [easy]
