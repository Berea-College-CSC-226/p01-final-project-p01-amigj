## Milestone 2: Code Setup and Issue Queue

```
    ** Getting started on the coding for the end and start screens. I don't have the assets yet, but soon then I'll upload.
    I'm just concerned about the coding the dialouge and buttons for choices, but I feel hopeful about it.
```

**Confidence**:

```
   I believe I can get this done by the time of next week. Right now I am behind, and trying to work on the start
   screen before I start on the actual game code. The game code will be alot because it's going to require story options,
   buttons, and such.
   
   The plan is this:
   1) start screen [semi-hard]
   2) game code [hard]
        2a) dialouge class working
        2b) character placeholder (box)
        2c) getting the story written/so dialouge can be implemented
        2d) button options
   3) end screen [semi-hard]
        3a) get the main end screen working
        3b) optional:win screen
        3c) optional:lose screen
   4) character assets impleted to make the program look pretty [easy]
